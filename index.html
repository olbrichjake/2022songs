<h1>Obi's top 50 songs of 2022</h1>
<p>2022 was a cool year. Will probs do a top 10 albums or something at the end but I am not great at reviewing music so did not want to rack my brain trying to listen through 100 albums trying to put my words together. Also I am a sucker for choruses and blast beats and I think these facts will put songs that are less deserving above better songs.</p>
<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">51.) Viagra Boys - Troglodyte</h2>
<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">50.) Hot Mulligan - Drink Milk and Run</h2>
<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">49.) Backslide - Shadow of Grief</h2>
<p>Local band that came out when I went to see Silent Planet this past fall. Not sure if this is a service or a disservice to the sound but one of the best cavemen metal bands I've heard in a hot minute. A constant barage of guitars and beatdown-type bounce to the song. Lyrics are pretty on the nose and at times feel jarring with how personal they are vs how I consume the music which is trying to do reps at the gym and want heavy background noise. There are parts where this melds together perfectly but other times where there are whailing vocals of a life I haven't connected to.</p>
