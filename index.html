<h1>Obi's top 50 songs of 2022</h1>
<p>2022 was a cool year. Will probs do a top 10 albums or something at the end but I am not great at reviewing music so did not want to rack my brain trying to listen through 50 albums trying to put my words together. Also I am a sucker for choruses and blast beats and I think these facts will put songs that are less deserving above better songs.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">50.) Architects - Burn Down My House</h2>
<p>I am still not a huge fan of this album. Craig from Stray From the Path put out a super pedantic tweet that was along the lines of "I studied music, this is objectively the best song of the year." So after putting off listening to this album for a long time I gave it a shot and I was pleasantly surprised. This song builds off a hook the same way a lot of the songs later down this list will. Maybe it's just me finally turning into a cynic and having a hard time grasping this is a architects song. Pretty basic beat but has an impactful message on top of it. A lot of production that feels kind of muddy but to me fits thematically with the song. Like a bit of smoke that dwells along the imagery of being apathetic about the world going up in flames around you. Side note, tear gas came up immediately after it and is slowly becoming my least favorite architects song, even above the shit mathrock their debut ep had.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">49.) Backslide - Shadow of Grief</h2>
<p>Local band that came out when I went to see Silent Planet this past fall. Not sure if this is a service or a disservice to the sound but one of the best cavemen metal bands I've heard in a hot minute. A constant barage of guitars and beatdown-type bounce to the song. Lyrics are pretty on the nose and at times feel jarring with how personal they are vs how I consume the music which is trying to do reps at the gym and want heavy background noise. There are parts where this melds together perfectly but other times where there are whailing vocals of a life I haven't connected to.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">48.) Guillotine - Stray From the Path</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iyVn13AXqXk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Stray From The Paths greatest strength and weakness is how much nu metal is in their sound. The verses are saturated with the nu metal sound but it also features one of the heaviest choruses which basically services as its own breakdown every time. This is delievered with punctuated lyrics "Death I can guarantee. As quick as a cut can bleed. When it drops, it can't be stopped. No plan B, just the guillotine." As most stray songs are, the lyrics revolve around crooked politicians and how the US revolves around servicing them. Tom on guitars and Craig on drums carry the song with intricate fills and riffs that pair well with heavy banging elements.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">47.) Queendom - チキチキバンバン </h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TpwcPI09I4g" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p> The chorus that forced more people to watch a show than I've ever seen an opening do before. The verses feel like a simplified melody the chorus has. I think the dance also constitutes as part of the song so added bonus.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">46.)Ocean Grove - Silver Lining</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pmseoUIZ1Y8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe> A weird journey for Ocean Grove to go from this bat shit insane nu metalcore band to losing their screamer and becoming this 90s rock tribute band. Despite them losing the weirdness that rose them to initial prominence, I think there is enough quirkiness in the year 2022 to set themselves apart. The song feels like a solid time machine and one of the rare upbeat songs in a scene pumped full of melancholy.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">45.) Viagra Boys - Troglodyte</h2>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iW4Gdsnr2Bg?si=fUdGN-8R6EI6uw6G" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Hey look, a song that probably deserves to be higher, but isn't because the chorus isn't as catchy and there aren't blast beats. It is a really fun song to sing along too. This band does a lot of good to bring punk into the 2020s. Each song they write has its own unique whit and charm attached to it. This song is no exception, having a peppy bpm accompanied by quirky whistles, flutes, buzzes, and beeps. "You ain't no ape, you're a trogolodyte" is a fun and catchy chorus. This band is worth more than what this list will give them credit for.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">44.) Scary Kids Scaring Kids (feat. Lil Lotus) - Knock It All Down</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZokRfOD1bpE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>What a weird song from a direction I never really felt this band would be in. This does not sound like a SKSK song but also it's been 15 years sine the last album so I hope they would not be a legacy act and just push forward. Lil Lotus sounds like a good fit with his two other projects. The emo rap vibe in the early verses from his solo proejct as well as the trailing off screams from If I Die First. The chorus is powerful and poppy. The beat in the background is infectious. The rest of the band feels tailor made to be a 2020s emo revival act that can pull influences from itself while still hanging with its contemporaries.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">43.) Destroy Rebuild Until God Shows - The Brighter Side </h2>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-YYyCnk_t9Y?si=x4abP2kx-AEK04nq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Every single syllable Craig Owens utters in this song is infectious. The instruments play in a way that there were 5 albums between this and the self titled that let them perfectly evolve with the bigger names in the post-hardcore scene. Despite this, I think the guitars sometimes feel nonexistent which isn't too much of an issue because the drums feel crisp in it and carry some of the verses and bridges.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">42.) The 1975 - I'm In Love With You </h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UVzVUDXoi0Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>One of the least quirky songs The 1975 has put out but very infectious and dancy. The simple beat and repetititve chorus gives it a decent amount of replayablity. I don't have much to say one way or the other about it. Just bopping.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">41.) Bad Omens - THE DEATH OF PEACE OF MIND</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ouW_RCAI0sg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Bad Omens has really exploded in a insane way. Big glow up from the debut album which had the band fend off Sempiternal rip off accusations for years. Noah's whispery delivery throughout the song is a great touch and adds to letting the excellent production on this song flourish. It has that cool bell sound which I feel has been missing form a lot of scene tracks lately. That little bell and the horns lead into a very powerful breakdown which is borderline absent at this level of hard rock.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">40.) Taylor Swift (feat. Lana Del Ray) - Snow on the Beach</h2>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ycE7bUq3-2k?si=iLW0cEukehp7mIl7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This spot should be reserved for Anti Hero because that just might be the catchiest Taylor song ever. Unfort I refuse to include a song that insinuates the existence of sexy babies despite the fact songs later on in for sure draw influence from lostprophets. Anyways, Snow on the Beach! The "weird but fucking beautiful" lines is randomly relatable as someone who grew up near the great lakes and sees snow on beach regularly.  This song is pretty low key and lana doesn't appear on it (the group vocals in the prechorus is very beautiful and fits with the next point). I think the production on it works well to fit the vibe. Maybe that's just Taylor's raw singing capabilities or just the mixing and effects, but the vocals are perfect for a dreamlike aesthetic. Fits the whole lavendar/purple vibe the album has.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">39.) Jason Richardson (feat. Tim Henson & Luke Holland - Upside Down</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c7T0TPBYGjs?si=Pd0-sjYSCBKtaHW6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>The music video features the whole gang in an arcade and plays various boss fights on the cabinet. The obvious jump is that Jason and Tim fight at one point but I think beyond that there are multiple acts of this song that fight against each other. Two conflicting ideas that evolve and then are stripped and repurposed. New guitars are brought in to break things up. Luke's drums dance really well off these ideas. Tim's indroduction is very notacable and stylisitically ingruinging. It comes with his own unique sampling and drum pieces before being looped out be a very classice Jason Richardson riff. </p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">38.) Proper. - Ganymede</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xy9iKWnzIU0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe> </p>
<p>Proper's such a versatile and unique act I want to recommend the whole album. This song in particular touches on some country influences as well as close to britpop. I think if the guitars weren't so light some parts also feel chuggy at times which makes sense because there's a hardcore song later in the album. The country influence is funny because the first verse talks about shipping off for war and killing people for oil oligarchs. The overall message is basically offing yourself so you aren't associate with this corporatocracy but is interjected with unique and quirky lyrics. "How's Pluto looking this time of year?/Love an underdog, I'll fit right in there/Or was it the underworld, I can't remember/But where I'm going no landlords may enter/This is my house, my domain."</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">37.) &#67602; &#67602; &#67602; - Sensation</h2>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qg8BG_EiDa0?si=KbkRH0UecodxQnIR" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Just a lowkey vibe of a song. The song has this flickering keyboard-esque sound that is mildly unnerving, but not in a horror aspect. Just enough to provide a backbone to this songs mood. Usually the verses start with just this sound and chino's vocals because added guitars, some bass effect (not guitar probably but idk what instrument/production makes what sound), and drums kick in to give diversity and life. The lyrics don't provide anything extra in terms of a hook and the energy is never elevated too high, but overall it's a pleasant moody track with a signature crosses sound.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">36.) Avril Lavigne - Deja Vu</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qLVhZEpDYwA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>This shit just makes me feel like a girl boss. idk if that's a good or a bad thing but it makes me feel good to listen to this. Definitely some corny lines but I couldn't give less of a shit. Every second of this song is insanely catchy. The pop rock guitars sound crisp. Production is on point. It should have a billion views.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">35.) Set to Stun - ENTER LUST</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqgQRirQKdU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Anything that ever happens that is original in metalcore stems from these guys. I will forever stay a champion. They are the main purveyers of shoving 8 songs into one and it never feels jarring. Each note trails into each other which may be due to the fact there are only three members so it pigeonholes how they can make these transitions. The way they can make everything work while being this limited and also being an s tier live performance is mindblowing. The opening sample is entrancing and sets the tone for the rest of the song and even when it disappears, I can still feel it roaming beneath everything. Damiens vocals are still pretty jarring, being pretty nasally but I want to say he implements some more midranged notes than he has in the past. The song also features some more backing vocals that serve more as an aspect of harmony rather than theatrics as this band regularly dives into creating a spectacle more than a concrete piece of music. Lyrically there isn't too much to right home about besides the sheer variety of subject matter and delivery. There are a number of callbacks to their previous project. More than anything, I'm just happy they are releasing music again as this has been only their second song in six or seven years.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">34.) Vaundy - mabataki </h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6h6AQbdTkaE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Vaundy is probably the japanese act that really burst out on the scene for me this year after the Ranking of Kinds OP and the one track whose name I do not know because it was in all kanji, but it appeared on a japanese alt rock playlist on youtube. Anyways, mabataki feels like a welcomes reskin from a number of acts from the mid to late 2000s. There's a particulare song I'm thinking of but can't pin down. Maybe someone else will hear it. A number of jrock bands from that era had this sort of downplayed vocal deliveries but Vaundy puts a spin on it when he elevates his vocals either through falsetto or raw power. The track offers this repetitive string bounce throughout the song, offering a backbone for the rest of the track build off of and it does so effortlessly. Then it seemlessly tears it away for a stripped down ending featuring the main hook.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">33.) Without Waves - Sleight in Shadows</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Fyo7rD0TFM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>I 100% only listened to it because it had a flamingo in the album art. The intro/chorus melody is reminiscent of I feel a million metal bands. I guess Ghost is the first one to come to mind but leaves that campus as soon as it's done. The guitars have some flair to them with a solid main riff and a fun solo a little over halfway through. The screams go over pretty well and accent the heavier parts of the song. I do not know what "There's a castle on my palm/ Sleight in shadows/Dusk 'til dawn" means but I fuck with it when they sing it.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">32.) Enterprise Earth - Unleash Hell</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1rRjxKi6VG8?si=mpn1EeV4IUs9AzFF" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Very beautiful intro with spanish guitars. Leads into a guitar-centric song death metal onslaught that ranges into deathcore and maybe progressive metal??? Some minor chugging but usually stays on the side of a noodly Rings of Saturn-esque type riff that's a little less technical but feels as spacy. The chugging in the breakdownfeel like it could come out of an After The Burial track (I fucking love After the Burial). The chorus is extremely fun which is rare for this genre is cringe and hates fun things that aren't guitars or murder. This chorus is heavily elevated without the guitar work that follows the chorus and either leads them into a solo or breakdown. Cool, diversified guitar work (sounds like they should have 3 guitarists, but don't). </p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">31.) Greyhaven - In a Room Where Everything Dies</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SxjH4e1n0sI" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe> I didn't "get" greyhaven for their last album Empty Black but this opening track off their new album definitely got me to appreciate the heavier elements from their sound. I'd say it's somewhat draws influence from the Every Time I Die camp with chaotic mathcore with some sort of rock to country rock type chorus. There's a point in the first verse where there's a "Damnit" dropped and I imagine the crowd goes stupid for that live. So much energy that's contrasted against this rocky chorus that feels like it's mashed from industrial or country or I don't know maybe it's just this sub sub genre that does this shit. "Bouquet in the corner/In a room where everything dies and dies fast/This cannot last." Everything is going to die and how can you live with that is delievered in such a frantic and frenzied manner that I has opened my mind to about 1000 more ways to cope with existence and half would get me arrested.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">30.) The Home Team (feat. Jeff Loomis and Veil of Maya) - Danger</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yEjH28x3-Mg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>This is one of the last songs I put it because I was really stuck between two of them. If you want one of the most infectious choruses of the year, check out "Watching All Your Friends Get Rich". I think this song provides a little more variety. The guitars stick out a little more. The melodies vary throughout the song a lot more as it is not as relient on one hook. I'm not sure where either Jeff or Veil of Maya come in but guitars sound clean so that's really all I can ask for. There is some form of a breakdown but I would put the album as a whole in the pop punkish category so it isn't super harsh or violent but probably gets people going in a pit.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">29.) Iodine - Pinegrove</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lP9dLjued9Q" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>A whimsical frolic through the prairie with the slightlest mathrock riff. It is such a pleasant experience for the ear through and through. Very beautiful and folky harmonies. The song itself is written from the perspective of quarantine and trying to write something authentic in the middle of isolation. I take from the chorus that isolated depression is the one true thing gathered from that experience. It's rare to gather memories from isolation only weighed down but these lingering ideas.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">28.) Void of Vision (feat. Hannah Greenwood) - ALTAR</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uu0mkCyMUf0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>I think this song does everything I love in a metalcore song. Quiet calm opening that erupts into blast beats. Electric vocals that shoot out all over the mix. And insane prelude into a thunderous breakdown that goes into an even harder breakdown. The dynamic between the two vocals works incredibly well. The switch between harsh vocals with heavy music can be jarring often times but I think it's seemless despite there not being any true transition between the two.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">27.) Polyphia (feat. $NOT) - Fuck Around and Find Out</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrSnnhe53ks?si=i7PU0w34RoVeY3KR" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p> This song does not feel like a Polyphia song so I feel a little bad about it being by far my most replayed song from the album. Probably the most tame guitars off the whole project but allows $NOT to flow off everything very fluidly. The Polyphia "vibe" is still there so in a sense feels like what think of when I think of Chon which exists to vibe. It doesn't sound like a Chon song but vibes as hard as a Chon song. Sonically very beautiful which is a little jarring because $NOT is threatening someone's life over the top of it but boppy nonetheless.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">26.)  Body Snatcher - The Question </h2>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MU0HzM0lPc?si=WSjt-d8hQGtoEMiU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p> I'd kill a child to this song. Every string hit feels like a buildup to something that is delivered a second later. Very moshy and very bouncy. It gains a new strength towards the end with the pre breakdown build up into an absolute bomb. Very caveman-esque breakdown. I go unga bunga every time.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">25.)  Kendrick Lamar (feat. Baby Keem and Sam Dew) - Savior</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HTAQxUXq674" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Mr. Morale was honestly the album that got me to actually listen to a Kendrick project all the way through. While I think the beat does not hold a candle to The Heart Part 5, but sonically this song holds up a little more for me consistently. The song hides aggression really well. If I just had this on in the background I wouldn't even feel it if it weren't for Baby Keem reiteriting the "Bitch ... are you happy for me," lines. Once I focused on the lyrics and actually "heard" Kendrick's words I can feel a snear that would be made for this delivery. The Covid lines, the captilism lines, the fairweather BLM protester lines all resonate incredibly well within the context of the songs. All while Kendrick is questioning whether the people around him, fans and critics, really give a shit about anything.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">24.) Jyocho  - Turn into Blue</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R12o-mS6wIk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>One of the most inventive bands in the japanese rock scene, and for sure at the top factoring a full-time flute player. The pianos dance like it's nobody's business throughout the grack while the vocals prance on top everything.  Draws a lot from post rock, midwest emo, jrock to make one of the most sonically pleasing songs of the year.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">23.) Thousand Below - Sabotage</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mP0HMKBt_5s" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>All things considered it's a pretty standard scene rock song about depression, but Thousand Below has a habit of making you relisten time and time again. The chorus is one of the catchiest things this year. James' cleans are pristine and he belts in a specific way that never really strays far from the path but captivates me every time. Not sure if there is much to say instrumentally. Everything works well together to propel the song forward, add structure and variety and all that jazz.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">22.)  Circa Survive - Buzzhenge</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgytsIQ5_Fo" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>I will have to let this grow on me because rise and youtubue and tidal hid this from me until December. There is a small chance this is my favorite track from the Two Dreams series despite the fact I had Even Better in my top 10 last year. The production is my favorite in the more mellow phase of Circa's career. The way Anthony's lines deliver at the beginning feel very comfortable in this pleasant sound before transitioning in to the harsher sounds that made them prevelant in the post-hardcore scene. There is even a guitar solo that I feel is very rare for more recent Circa songs. As time passes, this song may very well sneak into top 15 or top 10 range but will stay here for the time being.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">21.) Phoebe Bridgers - Sidelines</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RtOYYp010lA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Easily one of my favorite Phoebe Bridgers tracks. The simple beat to bring the song in. This lingering string so faintly existing in the background. Phoebe's meloncholic mutter than still carries distinct notes. "I'm not afraid of living on a fault line/'Cause nothing ever shakes me, nothing makes me cry," Is a beautiful line early on that sticks out to me in the onslaught of paralleled metaphors in the verses discussing the lack of fear because of this disdain for being where she is at in life, a person who barely exists.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">20.) Sza - Kill Bill</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SQnc1QibapQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Shoutouts Princess Diana. Lyrics feel purposefully immature, discussing the pursuit of a former paramore a la <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">OJ Simpson</span> kill bill. The instruments are pretty murky but pleasant. Almost like listening to an oldish record with beautiful melodies from sza played over them. Not sure how much I like the abrupt ending but I think it plays really well into the album as a whole and serves well for that role.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">19.) Silverstein - The Altar/Mary</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IczOdQStY48" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>This song is two songs but one but maybe three. It starts with this metalcore onslaught with fast drums and vocals that leads into their backing vocalist doing this viby rock chorus over a noodly metal riff. First half ends off with a combo of those two parts into one breakdown while Shane just screams "Somebody has to die" like 18 times. The "Mary" part is a very slow electronic piece with some autotuned delivery. The only thing that connects the two parts is the theming of the lyrics. It's probably the most unique song silverstein has ever done and for sure my favorite song of theirs in 5ish years.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">18.) An Offering To the Night - Jesus Piece</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AjkagOGYvIY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The boys are back! One of the heaviest tracks of the year accompanied by violent visceral lyrics . banger until the last second. Only breathing for a sexy bass section. Downtuned guitars litter the track with chugs and intermitten machine gun drums. Peak execution for this genre as expected from one of the best.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">17.)  ReoNaShall -  We Dance?</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wr_k36Zmo5g" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>The song offers so much for the listener to experience. There are acts to the song, so many instruements going, an infectious chorus, a great pre chorus, I think three different languages, a tap dancing section, a sax breakdown.

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">16.) American Foodball (feat. Miya Folick) - Fade Into You</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8maH5l6jn34" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>This is a cover from a Mazzy Star song, but it's too fucking good. Especially accompanied by the music video. One of the most haunting experiences I've gotten from watching a music video. The song slow and somber with sparse hits of the piano while slowly brings in the patented American Football guitars. Miya Folick is faintly heard in the backing vocals before coming in for her part with a painful "A stranger's light turns on slowly," and this realization this love is being blocked by something within their control but will it ever work?</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">15.) Fit For An Autopsy - Two Towers</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cm72YQcvjrY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Legally required to have a Fit For An Autopsy song. Will Putney's riff is priceless here. and keeps this a bop every playthrough. The very quiet opening separates this from a lot of FFAA songs but doesn't linger too long yet the song overall keeps the solemn tone. The breakdown is interesting because I feel like it doesn't separate itself much from the song (breaks down less I guess) but keeps the harmony of the song together which makes it a good addition. The lyrical meaning depicts the idea of who you are and who you will become. What separates these two? Is it a good thing? Is it a bad thing. Song honestly has provided a decent amount of reflection in my Have I betrayed the dreams of younger me or have I grown as a person.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">14.) brakence - deepfake</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zm7c2FDb7jQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>A very late entry into this list as I only just heard about this song a week ago, deepfake provides a very refreshing view into what can often be a stagnant subgenre in emo rap. Melodies are often sporatically interjected into basic flows. The initial beat is a very simple piano/drum ballad that erupts into this distorted bassboosted disaster before randomly turning into a midwest emo noodling. The lyrics are pretty juvenile in nature, talking about depression and weed that litter the subgenre but features enough witty wordplay to give a unique charm along with all the other production choices. Shit like "I'm straight flushed with poker on my face" is pretty corny but I think fits well in the middle of the song talking about how th emotions on the outside are different than the ones on the inside.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">13.) Billy Woods - Wharves </h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hZVodGcsul4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Favorite Rap project of the year goes to Billy Woods as per usual. Beat is a pretty simple tribal african instrumental with some produciton elements. Flows well with the lyrics discussing the colonizers roles in native lands. Speaking of affluent tours to tribal lands in the pacific islands and african slave trade. Delivered with as much passion as Billy Woods can deliver as he oftern reduces himself to borderline spoken word. The verses are filled with references to both pop culture "Cannibal tours, they came on all fours\Waterborne, eyes like Jaws" and other rappers "Never broke again, what he said on the farm"/""Fuck the world" Pac's screamin'" which provides some connection to deeper lyrics with a more worldy view my white ass needs to digest.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">12.) The New Age - Name Your Price</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t2NzEmOw5-M" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The band has an intesting of being just a random unsigned metalcore band to have a song pop off in 2013. They had a pretty solid album that I felt stripped away a lot of metal elements after that but I really only picked a song to champion and moved on. The 2013 ep was full of really strong guitars and varied vocals that could cross back and forth between cleans and screams in the same breath. Name Your Price is a radio friendly version of that I feel. The guitars are less mathcore and more radio rock with like a section that has a spanish guitar I think. The vocals are primarily clean but have a few bits that are the signature half way in between screech and sing with one extremely devastating low that hits a heavy but short breakdown. Short works though as the song never stays in the same place for more than 10 seconds. Very reminiscent of Set to Stun, just like a quarter the lenght of a Set to Stun song. The fast breaks in melodies and sound can be jarring but there is usually a piece dangling that links all the parts together, whether it be vocals, guitars, drums, bass, or production.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">11.) Make Them Suffer -  Doomswitch</h2>

<p>One of my favorite metal bands off all time return after the fallout with their former keyboardist vocalist. Nick is one of the best riff writers in metalcore for me. Everything is so groovy and bouncy. Sean is a demon on vocals and finds new ways to be inventive with his screams. The new keyboardist/vocalist, Alex, also adds a new element as she can scream. One of the complaints I had with recent Make Them Suffer projects was the transitions between Sean's and whoever was the clean vocalist at the time were pretty harsh and offputting. I think this addition makes the transition easier. This song also features one of the most electronic heavy breakdowns since the crabcore era that goes over super well for me. Also Alex busts out the keytar for this section which is hype. Genuinely one of the most talented bands in the metalcore scene.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">9.) Royal Coda - Even If</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HFTyOHSKAqE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Didn't make the actual album whic his sad because this is my favorite song by them so far. Kurt Travis is the best white person in 2022 at adding funk into his delivery. This is also a post hardcore so I want to say that's pretty challenging since it's being added over these noodly riffs that comes with what I'd describe as swancore. The chorus functions the same way as I mentioned Sabotage earlier where Kurt just kinda belts out works with some melody but you get hooked on the power, the lyrics, and the instruments to make it really stick with you. It ends with a more melodic rendition of the chorus slowly fading to black with a dialed back guitars which is always appreciated for a song that weighs heavily on guitars and a clean chorus.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">10.) The Callous Daoboys - Title Track</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d5xB-Vg75go" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Rising stars of mathcore, The Callous Daoboys a track that has been stuck in my head for the past couple of weeks. It starts out with a minute of ambience and rain before exploding into blast beats and imaginative lyrics before drawing it back into probably the most mellow part of the album, Celebrity Therapist. The math parts shoot in randomly as they should but I think this mellow parts feels 20 times more aggressive than the heavy parts. This depiction of despair in corporatacracy comes from all angles. The powerhunger from the top and the agony of the bottom "Get to the fountain of youth and give thanks/When it's made of oil." When you mention oil in a song, it usually bumps up like 5 spots for me given 3ish of my top 5 songs are about the Iraq War. The song ends with this very fluid roll of tumbling guitars and screams into what I think are pinch harmonics with a hammering "Go along/To get along" repeated a few times.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">9.) Gorillaz (feat. Tame Impala & Bootie Brown) </h2>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qJa-VFwPpYA?si=wdQ_OAFyCXWtd53p" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>My favorite Gorillaz song in a hot hot minute. A whole ass synthwave aesthetic pulled to perfection. it dies down slightly so Bootie Brown's lines are allowed a little more freedom to flow. These vocals are added with some distortion to blend into the song a little better. The production also has some synth in the fore ground giving the song a lot of dimension. Tame Impala's (idk the singer and I'm too far into this to do research) and Damien's vocals pair up really well and make any harmonies feel effortless. The ending will this falls off so effectively for a brilliant flow into any other song ever.

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">8.) Pool Kids - I Hope You're Right</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Ky9eXEjlhY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Shoutouts Brooklyn Vegan for this one. Just a random click I did one day. I believe someone in the band said that they originally wanted to name this Everlong II or something to that degree because of how much it sounds like a reinterpretation of that song. It feels a lot more polished than its 1999 counterpart. All the production sounds crisp which may or may not be offputting for some grunge purists. I believe it works well with how fading is used with the clear melodies of the Christine. She also adds this line to the prechorus of "You got me laughing now" and then follows it into a sarcastic sounding laugh reminiscent of Olivia Rodrigo's last album. With the add of production effects a lot of the guitars and vocals sound very haunting. It feels like a whisper but comes through so clearly. This all ends at the tail end of the song where the last chorus trails off into as close to a rasp as Christine gets and the guitars truly kick in to a small lick before a break down before an abrupt end.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">7.) Arm's Length - Dirge</h2>

<p>I am recompiling the list in November of 2023 as I find how to actually display html code in a way that doesn't make me want to claw my eyes out and so I'm going to add a song I discovered a year too late. Genuinely, this might my favorite closing track on any emo album ever. One thing that I always love in songs is how well they balance the sound in various ways to manage the atomsphere being painted in the lyrics. This is where the song genuinely gets its roots. Nothing is really technical, the lyrics aren't incredibly deep or out of the box, but it's composed so masterfully into an instanly classic song. About halfway through the song, the chorus ends and decomposes to just slow guitar strums that slowly builds up with drums and bells (?), all while some of the most beautiful emo lyrics are dropped for about a minute. This all culminates in an eruption of every volatile sound this band can produce. This song will only grow with time and will contend for top 10 or top 5 songs in the genre for me.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">6.) Lorna Shore - Sun//Eater</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mK8mw2X-4ug" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>In 2020 Lorna shores first single of that EP reached number two or three on my year end list. This year their debut single of the album reaches six. There were a couple other songs of the album that could be here but I think the highs of this song are a little bit stronger. The chorus "Omnipotent/I am the one/Icarus/I'll touch the sun" is very quick and very catchy. There is a very symphonic guitar + production that leads into both the song itself and the chorus that is a pristine standard bearer. As the lead intro it had ot include a breakdown with snarling vocals as to match To The Hellfire. Albeit this one is slight more stripped back without the machne gun drums from Bobby. Speaking of which, I have not seen them live but if Bobby can drum the way he does on a mixed and mastered album? Jesus Christ.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">5.) Ethel Cain - American Teenager </h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t2NzEmOw5-M" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>This song grew on me exponentially since I first heard it. Heartland Rock is about as foreign as the rock genre gets from me. I have negative understanding of the scene, but their music video thumbnail had an American Football reference, so I had to watch it. I think the intro riff feels like a good bridge from this midwest emo allusion to a heartland/country vibe that's featured in the rest of the song/album. It tackles some melodramatic high school angst tones in a moody way with dynamic shifts in what the guitars and productions can provide. Crying under the bleachers/questioning god/nascar reference/war. Kinda felt nostalgic for a life I didn't live, but was a composition of shared thoughts which a large swathe of people can find relatable. </p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">4.)  Counterparts - Whispers of Your Death</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N4Mca6dUtxc" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>This song has either a very narrow or broad audience and I'm not sure which one. For select people, this is one of the few songs that only has screaming that I would suggest to people who don't normally listen to this genre. The full story is the lead vocalist, Brendan, got a cat named Kuma who developed cancer. Shortly after the release of the song (Kuma is chilling in the music video) Kuma passed away. Brendan is someone chronically online and documented his struggles with dealing with this sickness and ultimate death. It translates incredibly well into the sound with heavy and brooding lyrics over clean guitars as I believe their original guitarist Jesse returned for this project. Perfect transitions between soaring guitar riffs and brooding chugging. I think the song really encapsulates the relationship between humans and pets as you invest a lot of yourself into keeping this creature, solely dependent upon you, alive and happy. Having vets and families and friends talk like death is absolute while you're still trying to do everything to prevent it is what saturates every second of this song. RIP Kuma.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">3.) Hippie Trim - Pleaser</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LsZUylvBLeA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe> This song goes so stupid. It's a shoegaze song that just shoves melodic hardcore in the middle of it. The early vocals are drony but carry a certain catchy melody that dances over a very kinda grungy riff. There's a pretty simple lyric that's "Do you know me well at all, at all" that's delivered Obviously switches up in the hardcore riff where the vocals are screamed and then transition into a deeper delivery that has the backing of the initial riff plus the drums from the hardcore part. The song ends with the lyrics described earlier as well before a slow flitter off to the next track.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">2.) The Devil Wears Prada - Cancer</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/COmK3U6JuCE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Pretty much every song off this album could've made this list. I believe four out of my five most listened to songs were from this album. Ultimately I did the song that probably is the simplest instrumentally. The chord progression throughout the verses is pretty simple yet effectively bouncy. The keyboards add a lot to this effect. Where this song carries is lyrically and vocally as it's one of the best written songs to me that tackles the impact of depression.&nbsp; "I hope that it's cancer\And not something else\'Cause I don't need any more things\I don't wanna talk about," Is the main chorus and the verses build off that with a sense of guilt following the first chorus. "How could I think such a thing? Who am I to say? Daily devastation that I can't validate." Mike takes the forefront for this song doing very crass and desparate screams while Jeremy interjects with very pleasant melodies in backing vocals. They combine in the chorus for a very gorgeous harmony. The song ends with a quiet interlude into an acoustic guitar into a distorted vocal reprise of the chorus. A very solemn and quiet end for a song about a solemn and quiet existence.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">1.) Kublain Khan (ft. Scott Vogel) - Swan Songs </h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NCvuEbimoDc" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>In early February my friend messaged me that a new Kublai Khan song dropped and I needed to check it out. This was his first recommendation in a hot minute and I straight up did not listen until March or maybe April. I'm an idiot. I'm a dumb foolish piece of garbage. Every line is written with an intense passion and vigor that I think is a calling card for the band. I think back to their debut ep with Guilty Dog hearing this. Here is this fucked situation we as a society allow and this is how I feel about it. There is a evolution though as I think older songs were very on the nose whereas here the lyrics display more indirect imagery. A quick summary is the song is about a world that unfortunately guides women into the dangerous system of truckstop prostitutes. I-80 is a notorious area for human trafficking in the midwest and women who were abused, degraded, etc find themselves there to find value in what they can do to survive.&nbsp; Each line in the open section rolls into each other so perfectly while the instruments cut in and out for very punctual and aggressive bursts. This section is paralleled later on where all guitar drops and it's just a bassline and some drums. Thre grooves throughout are incredible and always got me going from headbanging to that weird gyroscopic thing chickens do. Scott and Matt bounce off each other really well from verse to verse. While the style of the scream never changes, each word is barked with a clear emphasis and passion. The song ends off on a insert from who I presume to be a truckstop prostitute</p>
